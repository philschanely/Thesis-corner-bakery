        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Corner Street Bakery is a local bakery that serves the community
            through delectable pastries and wonderful serivces.</p>
        <p>Started in 1985, Corner Street Bakery was one of the only cafes
            in rural Cedarville, Ohio. It was started by Don and Jean Hazel.
            They wanted to create a place that would be a home away from home
            in terms of friendlyness and food. Jean is the main baker who tenderly crafts
            the pastries daily, while Don is the crazy baker in the back,
            trying out new combinations and running the register when needed.
            Together the Corner Street Bakery seeks to serve the community
            through delectable pastries and wonderful services.
            They also get involved in community festivals and parades.</p>
        <p>Make sure you check out our Instagram and like our Facebook page
            to keep up to date about seasonal menu options and specials.
